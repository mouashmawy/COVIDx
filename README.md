# COVIDx... My first programming project
Hello All...
This is the first coding project I work. It was for a course project. I really didn't finished it but is was good and made me enthusiastic for programming.

The program was during coronavirus quarinitie. So, I decide to make it about it.

This project was my lovely parnter Phelo.. You can find our photo in the credits in the application..

Hope it be a good memory..
